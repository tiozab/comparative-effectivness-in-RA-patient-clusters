# comparative-effectivness-in-RA-patient-clusters

This file provides the SAS code written by Theresa Burkard for the project described in the manuscript "Patient Groups in Rheumatoid Arthritis Identified by Deep Learning Respond Differently to Biologic or Targeted Synthetic DMARDs". The code is ordered chronologically. Between "02" and "03", the patient population was clustered using the deep learning library Pytorch running the file train.py from the folder "clustering_python.zip"
