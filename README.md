# comparative-effectivness-in-RA-patient-clusters

This file provides the SAS code written by Theresa Burkard for the project described in the manuscript 
"Patient Groups in Rheumatoid Arthritis Identified by Deep Learning Respond Differently to Biologic or Targeted Synthetic DMARDs".
The code is ordered chronologically. 
Between "02" and "03", the patient population was clustered using the deep learning library Pytorchin Python. 
However, the Python code developed by Maria Kalweit to cluster patients in this project is under evaluation for intellectual property (i.e. a patent) and cannot be exported. 
Thus, neither public sharing of the developed code nor sharing upon request is possible.
